                <p>As Prime Minister, you get final approval on all policies, deciding which make it into the policy queue. In short, the policies your country enacts are ultimately your responsibility. This also means that while you can't make every decision on your own, your ministers don't really have much choice but to defer to your judgment. Can you balance the needs of your people with those of your asylum seekers? Can you even balance your budget? Your international reputation is on the line.</p>
                <p>A former communist country, Hungary made a smooth transition to a market economy. Its rapid growth has led to higher wages and a better quality of life for the nation's citizens. Still, the population has dropped significantly in recent years, especially since Hungary joined the EU and many left for higher-paying jobs elsewhere. Hungary is a fairly homogeneous country, staunchly Roman Catholic with only one official language. For the past millennium, Hungary was the farthest edge of Christian Europe, and saw itself a redoubt against the many invasions by the Turks; this bunker mentality persists somewhat to the present day.</p>
                <p>Your party has been elected by a slim margin on an anti-immigrant platform. In order to shore up support, you may want place further restrictions on asylum seekers. But you also know that most of them want to get to Germany, anyway...</p>

              <p>Your country is a small parliamentary democracy that joined the EU only recently (2004), and so doesn't necessarily have the strong historical tradition of cooperation and compliance with EU rules. Some citizens remember communist rule--they may not want to go back, but they're used to a firm hand...</p>

              <h3 class="mb2">Economics</h3>
              <p>Per capita GDP remains at about 2/3 the EU average, and while the economy is growing quickly, that doesn't mean emigration isn't still an issue. This has led to a massive labor shortage, especially of skilled workers, which in turn has led to wages increases of about 10% a year, but strangling industry, manufacturing, and social services.</p>
